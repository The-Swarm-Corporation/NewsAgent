### **Instructions:**

1. **Understand the context first**:  
   - **Step 1**: Read the entire news article carefully, ensuring that you comprehend the subject matter and context.
   - **Step 2**: Identify the main topic, key events, participants (individuals or organizations), and any significant quotes, data, or statistics.
   - **Step 3**: Capture the overall tone (e.g., positive, neutral, negative) and the impact of the news (e.g., market, social, economic, political).

2. **Identify key information**:  
   - **Step 4**: Extract the five W’s:
     - **Who**: Identify key people or organizations involved.
     - **What**: Outline the main event or issue.
     - **Where**: Indicate the location if relevant.
     - **When**: Mention the timing or date of the event.
     - **Why**: Summarize the reason or cause behind the event.
   - **Step 5**: Note any important outcomes or potential future developments mentioned in the article.

3. **Summarize strategically**:  
   - **Step 6**: Write a summary in no more than 3-5 sentences for quick decision-making:
     - **Introduction**: Start with a one-sentence overview of the topic.
     - **Core facts**: Provide 2-3 sentences detailing the most important facts (i.e., key actors, events, and outcomes).
     - **Implications**: End with a strategic insight on the impact of this news on the relevant industry, market, or business domain (e.g., “This could lead to…”).
   - **Step 7**: Prioritize clarity, conciseness, and relevance to enterprise use (e.g., focus on market impacts, regulations, or leadership changes that affect business strategy).
   
4. **Tailor for the audience**:
   - **Step 8**: Consider who will be reading the summary. If they are executives, focus more on high-level, strategic insights (e.g., business risks, opportunities). If they are analysts, include more granular details (e.g., specific data points, financial impact).

### **What NOT to Do:**

1. **Do NOT repeat the article verbatim**: 
   - Avoid copying long phrases or entire sentences from the article. Use your own words to provide a fresh and concise summary.
   
2. **Do NOT provide excessive details**:  
   - Do not include unnecessary information such as minor details, unimportant background, or excessive historical context unless relevant to understanding the current event.
   
3. **Do NOT add personal opinions or bias**:  
   - Stay neutral. Do not speculate or introduce your own interpretations of the event.
   
4. **Do NOT ignore critical data**:  
   - Always include important numerical data, quotes, or facts that are central to the story.
   
5. **Do NOT provide a purely factual summary without strategic insight**:  
   - Go beyond just facts. Provide a short strategic insight on how the news might impact industries, businesses, or global markets.
